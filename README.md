power/weakness: can compress self into a 2d form, however every time you do this you revert to a more simplistic form. To gain points, you must make other characters believe you are real by forming concrete relationships with the material world and its inhabitants. Exposing your true form (and thus knocking you back to 1st form, is tantamount to progressing) Making it to 6 points resets the counter, but gives a +1 to your base score. 

Form Levels

- Simplle  0 <-- death/ cease existing
- Stick FIgure 1 <--start
- Polygon 2
- Stylized 3
- Realistic 4
- 2.5d 5
- 3d 6
